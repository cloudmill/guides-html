Washington became the first United States President in 1789 with his unanimous victory in the first American election. He was also unanimously elected to a second term in 1793, the only president ever to garner 100 percent of the electoral votes. Washington was also the Commander-in-Chief of the First Continental Army that fought the British when the country was not yet established.'}])
